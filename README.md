# Data Institute - Deep Learning Certification University of San Francisco
This program is lead by Jeremy Howard of FastAI. In this repository, it consists my interpretation of image classification problems using FastAI's library. Please check at the main folder to see my implementation of the program.

The main objective of this certification are:
1. Apply transfer learning to image classification problems
2. Use neural networks for recommendation algorithms
3. Use recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks for text classification problems
3. Apply neural networks to tabular data and learn embeddings for categorical variables
